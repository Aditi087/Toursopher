                <p>Darjeeling is one of the attractive places in India. Not only Indian or Bengalis but also a vast number of Bhutani, Nepali, and Bangladeshi come to visit that place.<br/>
                It is one of the most attractive places in India.<br/>
                Not only for being the trader of tasty tea, but Darjeeling is also very famous due to the visiting places like Madhuban Park, Surya Sen Park, Tiger Hill, Batasia Loop, Darjeeling Ropeway so and so.</p><br/>
                <h5>Observatory Hill</h5>
                <p>From my hotel, I walked towards Observatory Hill through the Mall. After reaching, I stood there, with my keen eyes searching for the light on Mt. Kanchenjunga within the dark sky. It was very cold. I have always experienced a clear sky during this season. As the sun rises, the first light on the peak of Mt. Kanchenjunga gave an understanding of actual realistic colors. The color gradually started to glow with changing position of the sun.
                    It is said that best view of the sunrise over Mt. Kanchenjunga in Darjeeling is from Tiger Hill. I won't say it is bad, but since I have experienced the view several times from Tiger Hill, so this time, I thought of going around by foot and see the sunrise from Observatory Hill, behind Darjeeling Mall.
                    Take away: While watching the sunrise, you will be accompanied by many local walkers working out in the cold morning.</p><br/>

                <h5>Glenary's</h5>
                <p>After viewing the sunrise, I walk down to the Mall for a fresh cup of tea in the stands. Leisure time sitting on the wooden plank made chairs, sipping tea and see local people around.<br/>
                    Take away: This Mall has seen the history of changes over the years. Don't miss to spend some time to experience the same.</p>

                <h5>Mahakal Temple</h5>
                <p>Located on the Observatory Hill and encircled at its bottom by the Mall Road stands Mahakal Mandir. As you walk along the Mall road, you will see this steep hill rising. It takes about 15 minutes of an uphill walk to reach the top. Though the walk is tiring, in the end, the reward is awesome. The temple is great! If you are really out of breath, there are benches there where you can take some rest.</p>

                <p>Take away: There are thousands of Buddhist prayer flags fluttering all over and hanging from the trees. Can't miss the view and experience.</p><br/>
                <h5>Old Cemetery</h5>
                <p>Cemeteries are places which we generally don’t include in our to-visit list while traveling. But this time, after referring several travel sites, I came through about Darjeeling Old Cemetery which is also known as the English Cemetery, resting place of those early British settlers who created this beautiful gem of a hill town. It's an easy 3 km walk from Chowk Bazaar area along Lebong Road.</p>

                <p>When you are walking on Lebong Cart Road, you cannot miss the view of the beautiful Happy Valley Tea Estate. I was standing there seeing the setting sun. The experience is awesome.</p>
